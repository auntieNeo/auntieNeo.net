title: First Post! Wooooo!
---

I'm starting this blog with the hope that, with a little luck, I might find the
time to post about some of the projects or programming tidbits I'm working on.

Recently, through the magic of RSS, I've been reading more programming-oriented
blogs blogs such as <a href="http://gamasutra.com/">Gamasutra</a> and the <a
href="http://blog.llvm.org/">LLVM Project Blog</a> (not just wasting time on <a
href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>, hah). I thought it would be nice to
have a blog of my own just in case I find something interesting I would like to
share. It's not that I haven't found things to blog about; it's just difficult
to compulsively blog about something without... actually having a blog in the
first place.

So here's my blog, and here's a blog post about my blog. If you're here to read
blog posts about my blog, you're in for some disappointment, because I don't
anticipate writing any more blog posts about my blog. I do, however, plan on
writing about things I'm actually interested in, which may or may not include
topics such as <a
href="http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/general-programming/using-varadic-templates-for-a-signals-and-slots-implementation-in-c-r3782">C/C++
hacks</a>, <a href="http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/">Vim plugins</a>,
<a href="http://nixos.org/">obscure Linux distributions</a>, and <a
href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">Japanese study</a>, to name
a few. I might even just reblog <a
href="http://zolomon.com/blog/2011/05/28/game-programming-gems-table-of-contents/">whatever</a>
<a href="https://github.com/michaelforney/swc">I</a> <a
href="http://hackaday.com/2014/08/16/an-fpga-based-6502-computer/">bookmark</a>
if I'm feeling lazy.
