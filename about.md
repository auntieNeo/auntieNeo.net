Hello! My name is Jonathan Glines, and this is my weblog. It's hip. It's
minimal. I hope it proves useful to someone besides myself someday.

If you don't find my blog to be hip, or if you have some other question or
comment, feel free to <a href="mailto:auntieNeo@gmail.com">e-mail me</a>. I'm
also present on IRC and can be found most days on <a
href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>'s <a
href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=peltkore">#peltkore</a> and <a
href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=nixos">#nixos</a> channels as the
user "auntie".

I am currently attending school at <a
href="http://www.usu.edu/http://www.usu.edu/">Utah State University</a> while
simultaneously working at <a href="http://isu.edu/">Idaho State University</a>.
If you want an idea of what else I might be working on, take a look at my <a
href="https://github.com/auntieNeo">GitHub page</a>.
